/*
 * Sereal Protocol version 1, see constants below docs.
 *
 * Generally speaking, structures are serialized depth-first and each item
 * is preceded/defined by a 1-byte control character, see table below.
 * All packets of Sereal data must be preceded by a header. The header structure
 * is as follows:
 * Bytes 1-4: Magic string "srlX" where X is the character of the protocol version,
 *            in binary. So for protocol version 1, the magic string is "srl\x01".
 * Next: A varint describing the length of the rest of the header.
 *       Since in protocol version 1, there is currently nothing else in the header,
 *       this varint is always 0 (but that will change). Decoders must be able to
 *       skip the parts of the header that they know nothing about using the total
 *       header length.

 * 
 * F = Flag bit to indicate if the item needs to be tracked during deserialization.
 *     The offset of the tag byte should be remembered, so that it can be referenced
 *     later.
 * 
 * * Dealing with self referential and cyclic structures:
 * While dumping any item with a refcount>1 (including weakrefs) the offset of the tag
 * needs to be tracked. The items F flag is NOT set. Should the item later be encountered
 * during dumping an alias or ref item will be generated with the offset in a varint, and
 * the F flag will be set. 
 * 
 * * Handling objects
 * During dumping the dumper is expected to maintain a mapping of class name to id. Whenever
 * it encounters a new class name it emits a "declare class tag" and then emits the appropriate
 * ref tag with the "is class" bit set.
 *    
 * * Varints
 * Varints are variable length integers where the high bit of each segment (normally a byte
 * but in some cases less) indicates if there is another byte to follow, with the bytes in 
 * least significant order first.
